ðŸ“Š Data Analyst Journey

Welcome! I'm Ayan, and this repository documents my hands-on learning as I work toward becoming a data analyst.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Strengthen Python skills for data manipulation and analysis
- Practice SQL for querying and joining datasets
- Build Excel dashboards and apply logical formulas
- Visualize insights using matplotlib, seaborn, and Power BI
- Learn to tell compelling stories with data

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `python-exercises/` â†’ Data cleaning, EDA, and mini-projects
- `sql-practice/` â†’ Query challenges and case studies
- `excel-dashboards/` â†’ Sample dashboards and formulas
- `visualizations/` â†’ Charts and plots with Python
- `notes/` â†’ Reflections, resources, and learning logs

ðŸ§  Why This Matters
I believe data analysis is not just about numbersâ€”it's about uncovering patterns, solving problems, and making informed decisions. This repo is my sandbox for learning and sharing.

ðŸ“Œ Status
This is a beginner-friendly, evolving repository. Iâ€™ll be updating it regularly as I grow.

Thanks for visiting!
