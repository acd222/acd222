👋 Hi, I'm Ayan — a curious learner on the path to becoming a Data Engineer.

🔍 I explore Python, SQL, Excel analytics, and data visualization tools with a methodical mindset.

🎯 Currently focused on:
- Building strong foundations in data pipelines and ETL processes
- Understanding cloud platforms like AWS and GCP
- Practicing real-world data wrangling and transformation

📚 I also love connecting technical learning with cultural depth—especially through Bengali poetry and film.

🛠️ Let’s build something meaningful, one dataset at a time.
