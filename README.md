👋 Hi, I'm Ayan — a data enthusiast on a journey to become a thoughtful and impactful Data Analyst.

📊 I explore data with Python, SQL, Excel, and visualization tools like matplotlib and Power BI.

🔍 My approach: methodical, curious, and always seeking meaning behind the numbers.

🎯 Current focus:
- Data cleaning, transformation, and storytelling
- SQL queries and Excel dashboards
- Visualizing insights with Python and BI tools
- Connecting data to real-world decisions

🎬 I also enjoy interpreting Bengali poetry and film — because analysis isn't just technical, it's emotional too.

📈 Let’s turn data into understanding.
